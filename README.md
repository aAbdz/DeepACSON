# DeepACSON
Automated Segmentation of White Matter in 3D Electron Microscopy

DeepACSON was developed by Ali Abdollahzadeh at the University of Eastern Finland to trace the entirety of myelinated axons in low-resolution, large field-of-view 3D electron microscopy images of white matter.

We used BM4D filter to denoise 3D-electron microscopy images:
